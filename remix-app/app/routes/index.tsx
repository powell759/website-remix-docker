        <h2>ðŸ‘‹ About Me:</h2>
        <p>
          I'm passionate about developer velocity. In my day job I'm part of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/intro">wishlist team at Amazon</a>
          where I gravitate towards devops projects. In my previous role at <a href="https://www.epic.com">Epic Systems</a> I built developer tools.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm concerned that many engineers waste their time dealing with needlessly complex tools; building and rebuilding
          software that already exists. I want to find solutions that help engineers focus on solving
          problems that matter, not problems that have already been solved.
